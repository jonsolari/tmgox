## the Mountain Goats Online eXchange

This is a price tracking app for out-of-print releases by [the Mountain Goats](http://www.mountain-goats.com/).

It is built with React and uses the Discogs API to check the current lowest price of each item. 

Ebay didn't want to grant me API access. Why you gotta do me like that, ebay?
